::Node, impl(new_node)  {::left, ::right, ::data,}
::BST, impl(new_BST) {::head,}

I think this is how I want constructors to work, idk
::@new_node, (data) => Node{[left] = [0], [right] = [0], [data] = [data]}

::@new_BST, () => BST{}

I'd like to be able to overide functions like this which should be doable with LOOKAHEAD
::@new_BST, (data) => BST{[head] = Node.new_node(data)}
